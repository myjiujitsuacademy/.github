# myjiujitsuacademy

We create software to support the Jiu Jitsu development and the Jiu Jitsu community. 

### Our missions:
* Grow as a community
* Help and support the Jiu Jitsu development and the Jiu Jitsu community
* Implement a cheap, scalable and adaptable solution. 
* Engage the community members and create different working groups 

### Our first goal
Academies tend to share content with their students and the outside world via group chats and social media. This results to unstructured and scattered content which we can make no use of. We are trying to change that and make it accessible for all schools.
* Support teams maintain their media content and social media sharing using what we call an "Academy first content sharing" approach as we call it. This means that we have a central storage of media content, which we can also share at any time with our students, the world or the social media.

### Technology stack
* k3s single node production ready Kubernetes cluster - Great to achieve scalability while having a cheap solution
* Nextcloud - Great for communities and teams to manage documents and media files
* Next.js - React framework that support SSR, used for our landing page
