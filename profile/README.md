# myjiujitsuacademy

We create software to support the Jiu Jitsu development and the Jiu Jitsu community. 

### Our missions:
* Grow as a community
* Help and support the Jiu Jitsu development and the Jiu Jitsu community
* Implement a cheap a scalable and adaptable solution. 

### Our first goal
Academies tend to share content with their students and the outside world via group chats and social media. This results to unstructured and scattered content which we can make no use of. We are trying to change that and make it accessible for all schools.
* Support teams maintain their media content and social media sharing
